Why no commentary in the code?
This program uses an algorithm that is the simplified version of the Starmaps Generator, which is in another library of mine. You can see the commentary there if you need.

Input (in.txt) format:
1 number indicates how many own-stones
coordinates of each own-stone (2 numbers each, from 1 to 9, row first and col second)
1 number indicates how many opponent's own-stones
same as above
1 number indicates how many neutral-stones
same as above
2 number that give a upper-bounf of the largest possible score for self/opponent.
(input 16 if uncertain or the game just starts)

Output format:
2 numbers show the largest possible score for self/opponent.
Values of each place on the board.
Form 1 only consider to score most points as possible. (1000 tries)
Form 2 only consider to let opponent score least points as possible. (1000 tries)
Form 3 is the sum of 1 and 2. But may not be the best, since there could be an inequal ratio. 
Form 4 is the difference of 1 and 2. But may not be the best for the same reason.
